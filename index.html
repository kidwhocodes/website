    <h3>Please let me know of any bugs or broken links</h2>
    <p>Some of my favorite things to do are:
    <ul>
        <li>Reading - some of my favorite books are "Math with Bad Drawings", "Soonish", and "What If."</li>
        <li>Math, not really the basic stuff - like multiplying fractions. But the advanced/interesting stuff, like the pythogarean theroem and the number TREE(3) </li>
        <li>Coding. Since it is pretty cool to make a computer do whatever you want it to do.</li>
    </ul>
